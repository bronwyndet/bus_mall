          <p>Thank you for participating in our <b>Bus Mall Product Survey</b>. All votes are anonymous, we do not retain personal information from survey participants. The voting information collected will be used to help drive future production decisions on our product offerings.</p>

        <h2>Survey Instructions</h2>
          <p>Please 'click' on whichever of the three images shown that you would be most likely to purchase out of the three. <b>Please be sure to click only on an image (and not the area surrounding the image)</b>.</p>
          <p>There will be 25 rounds of images and following the last round you will have an opportunity to review the results from all completed surveys. Results are calculated on a simple voting tally and as a percentage of the votes per times the image was displayed.</p>
