          <h2>Survey Instructions</h2>
            <p>Please 'click' on whichever of the three images shown that you would be most likely to purchase out of the three. <b>Please be sure to click only on an image (and not the area surrounding the image)</b>.</p>
            <p class="p_last">There will be 25 rounds of images and following the last round you will have an opportunity to review the results from all completed surveys. Results are calculated on a simple voting tally and also as a percentage of the votes per times the image was displayed.</p>
